Custom Scoreboard is a mod for modern Minecraft and Hypixel SkyBlock, inspired by [SkyHanni](https://modrinth.com/mod/skyhanni).
This mod lets you fully customize your scoreboard, making it easier to focus on the information that matters most while you're running a
Dungeon, slaying a Voidgloom or grinding for a Mineshaft in a Party!

Features:

- Fully customizable scoreboard layout.
- Custom Lines beyond Hypixel's Lines, like the current Mayor or your Party.
- Rounded Background

Later Planned Additions:

- Image as a Background
- Elements that are in SkyHanni and not this mod, like Quiver, Power, ...

Using /customscoreboard, or /cs for short, you can open the config and start customizing your Custom Scoreboard experience!
